## Overview
This project is part of the "Projetos em Ciência de Dados" course, a 7th-semester undergraduate course in the Data Science program. We aim to develop a search engine tailored to music data, focusing on lyrics, artists, and genres. Utilizing the comprehensive music database provided by MusicBrainz, we strive to enhance the user experience by matching musical tastes and improving search efficiency, potentially integrating audio sources such as Spotify and YouTube Music to enrich our offerings.

## Project Goals
- To create an efficient and user-friendly search engine for music-related queries.
- To leverage the MusicBrainz database to provide detailed information on lyrics, artists, and genres.
